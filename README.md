    <h1>Overview 🕵️</h1>
    <p>🖥️ Hello. I'm M, a 16-year-old (jokingly) self-appointed mathematics and cybersecurity major student, while actually studying data analysis in real life. I mainly program in C++, but I'm also learning how to write codes in C#; I'll probably learn another few more languages, such as Rust or Go in the future.</p>
    <p>⚛️ Despite being a computer science student, I have a keen interest in quantum mechanics; I can only learn this subject myself since there are no universities near where I live that offer this course. That being said, I am teaching myself calculus, linear algebra, relevant theories and equations [e.g. general/special relativity theory, Lagrangian mechanics, reference frames, angular momentum, etc.] if I am not studying DSA.</p>
    <p>👨🏻‍💻 I have also taken a great interest in cybersecurity, mostly because I want to learn how different types of malware work, and the various methods of exploiting the vulnerabilities of a system. </p>
    <p>Here are some programming languages that I am learning and using for the respective purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>DSA/General:</b> C++/C#</li>
  <li><b>Website Building:</b> HTML/JavaScript</li>
  <li><b>Database:</b> SQL</li>
